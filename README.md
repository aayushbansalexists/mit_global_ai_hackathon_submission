|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vector Search         | FAISS vector database for similarity search in R^384 space       |
| Embedding Model       | SentenceTransformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for vectorization       |
| LLM Integration       | Google Gemini API for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)       |
| Document Processing   | PyPDF2 with optimized chunking strategies                        |
| Pattern Matching      | Specialized regex patterns for renewable energy contracts        |
| Frontend              | Streamlit UI with interactive components and PDF viewing         |

## üìä Performance Metrics

- **Field Extraction Confidence**: 86% average across key fields
- **Response Time**: 501ms mean response time
- **Scaling Capability**: Tested with thousands of document chunks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run: 
```
streamlit run app.py
```
üìñ Usage
Upload Documents: Add PDFs and Excel files to the data room

Extract Information: Auto-populate checklist fields from documents

Query Documents: Ask natural language questions about your documents

View Sources: Click on source links to view original documents

üß† How It Works
The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

Document Processing: PDFs and Excel files are chunked into semantic units

Vector Embedding: Each chunk is embedded into a high-dimensional vector

Similarity Search: FAISS retrieves the most relevant chunks per query

Contextual Understanding: Gemini API generates answers using retrieved chunks

Source Attribution: Every response links back to the source document
